It is a main task of exploratory data analysis, and a common technique for statistical data analysis, used in many fields, including pattern recognition, image analysis, information retrieval, bioinformatics, data compression, computer graphics and machine learning. \n\nClustering is the task of dividing the population or data points into a number of groups such that data points in the same groups are more similar to other data points in the same group and dissimilar to the data points in other groups. It is basically a collection of objects on the basis of similarity and dissimilarity between them.\n\n![](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/merge3cluster.jpg)\n\nRef: Wikipedia & https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/clustering-in-machine-learning/\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Different type of Clustering Alogrithm\n1.

Affinity Propagation\nAffinity Propagation involves finding a set of exemplars that best summarize the data.\n\n### 2. Agglomerative clustering\nAgglomerative clustering involves merging examples until the desired number of clusters is achieved.\n\n### 3. BIRCH Clustering \n(BIRCH is short for Balanced Iterative Reducing and Clustering using Hierarchies) involves constructing a tree structure from which cluster centroids are extracted.\n\n### 4. DBSCAN Clustering \nwhere DBSCAN is short for Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise involves finding high-density areas in the domain and expanding those areas of the feature space around them as clusters.\n\n### 5. K-Means\nK-Means Clustering may be the most widely known clustering algorithm and involves assigning examples to clusters in an effort to minimize the variance within each cluster.\n\n### 6. Mini-Batch K-Means\nMini-Batch K-Means is a modified version of k-means that makes updates to the cluster centroids using mini-batches of samples rather than the entire dataset, which can make it faster for large datasets, and perhaps more robust to statistical noise.\n\n### 7. Mean Shift\nMean shift clustering involves finding and adapting centroids based on the density of examples in the feature space.\n\n### 8. OPTICS\nOPTICS clustering (where OPTICS is short for Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) is a modified version of DBSCAN described above.\n\n### 9. Spectral Clustering\nSpectral Clustering is a general class of clustering methods, drawn from linear algebra.\n\n### 10. Gaussian Mixture Model\nA Gaussian mixture model summarizes a multivariate probability density function with a mixture of Gaussian probability distributions as its name suggests.\n\n![](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/_images/sphx_glr_plot_cluster_comparison_0011.png)\n\nRef: https://machinelearningmastery.com/clustering-algorithms-with-python/\nRef: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/clustering.html\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# <center> <font size=20 color='Blue'> Unsupervised learning </font> </center>\nClustering the Countries by using Unsupervised Learning for HELP International\n\n### Objective: \nTo categorise the countries using socio-economic and health factors that determine the overall development of the country.\n\n### Problem Statement:\nHELP International have been able to raise around $ 10 million.
